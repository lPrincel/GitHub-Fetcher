# GitHub Profile Fetcher 🔍

A clean, responsive web application that interacts with external APIs to fetch real-time developer data. It demonstrates core modern web development skills, including asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and JSON data parsing.

**Live Demo:** [Click here to view the live project](https://lPrincel.github.io/github-fetcher/)

## Features
* **Real-Time API Integration:** Communicates seamlessly with the public GitHub REST API.
* **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Uses modern `async/await` and `fetch()` to retrieve JSON payloads without freezing the UI.
* **Dynamic DOM Manipulation:** Instantly injects the retrieved data (avatar, bio, repository count, followers) directly into the HTML structure.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try/catch` block to gracefully handle invalid usernames and display user-friendly error messages.
* **Responsive Dark-Mode UI:** Styled with pure CSS to mirror the clean, dark-mode aesthetic of GitHub itself.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and search input handling.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox and custom styling for a polished card interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic, API requests, and dynamic rendering.
